ec2-ckup      Sai Gudivada    HomeWork5

The tool was written in Python, it helps a user to
to perform a backup into an aws ec2 volume. The tool
is a collection of various functions to perform the
required operations. I have used subprocess to pass the
commands and read the outputs from it.

Functionality of the tool:
-checks if the directory provided is valid
-makes sure the size of the volume provided is enough to
perform the backup
-If the given backup directory is root, it checks if the user
sudo user and terminates if it is not a sudo
If volume is provided:
 	The tool spins up an instance in the same availability
zone of the volume. Before spinning up the instance it checks
for the following details.
If volume is not provided:
	It spins up an instance and then creates a volume in the
same availability zone of the instance.

-attach the volume to the instance and tar the directory to
the given volume.
-terminate the instance.

- Used Red hat image id's to support the tool across many regions.

Lessons Learned:

First of all i tried to address feedback provided in the
homework 2, some of the key take away from the homework
are tried to use functions to perform operations, handled
different availability zones with the help of mapping function.
used ec2 wait instead of time.sleep(),Used Error and exit statements.

Challenges:
-waiting for the instance to get ready for SSH was so long which resulted
in long waiting to perform the SSH
